Hi, this is my first react project. I have created a simple input and display.
The purpose of this was to practice learning ReactJS, utilising React Hooks and Props, learn JSX, learn about state and the significance of immutability and mutation of objects.

I have used create-react-app as the front-end and express js as the back-end. I use Mongoose as a framework to access my MongoDB Atlas database.

Things to work on
  - File Structure
  - Refactoring
  - Modulising certain components and middleware
